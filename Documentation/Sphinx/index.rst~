The PKP Code Documentation
==========================

This is the code documentation of the PKP program. The general structur of the classes is the following:

- There are pyrolysis program (like CPD and FG-DVC) specific ones to write the configuration files, launch their program and read the specific output files and support the other classes with the pyrolysis program specific data. Every of the programs has also it's own class calculating the species and energy balance.
- The pyrolysis program independent Fitting classes.
- The IO-classes reading the user input and the classes generaing the output, e.g. for the FG-DVC coal file.

The manual is also structured the same way. Firstly the specific classes for CPD and FG-DVC are introduced, followed by the fitting classes.

Required additional python libraries for using PKP are:

- scipy
- numpy
- pylab
