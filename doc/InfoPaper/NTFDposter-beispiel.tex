%%% Each box has a name and can be placed absolutely or relatively.
%%% The only inconvenience is that you can only specify a relative position 
%%% towards an already declared box. So if you have a box attached to the 
%%% bottom, one to the top and a third one which should be in between, you 
%%% have to specify the top and bottom boxes before you specify the middle 
%%% box.

  Fitting statistical 2D and 3D shape models to images is necessary for a
  variety of tasks, such as video editing and face recognition. Much progress
  has been made on local fitting from an initial guess, but determining a close
  enough initial guess is still an open problem. We propose a method to locate
  fiducial points, which can then be used to initialize the fitting.
